This project analyzes digital advertising performance across multiple campaigns, platforms, and audience segments using Power BI. The objective was to evaluate campaign effectiveness, diagnose ad-level performance, and understand user engagement patterns to support data-driven optimization decisions.

The analysis integrates campaign, ad, user, and event-level data to compute key performance indicators such as impressions, engagement rate, and cost efficiency. A structured dashboard flow was designed, beginning with an executive overview and progressively enabling deeper analysis through campaign comparisons, ad-level drill-through, and focused tooltip insights.

Advanced Power BI features such as drill-through navigation, tooltip pages, and DAX-based efficiency metrics were implemented to enhance analytical clarity while maintaining proper business context. The final dashboards provide actionable insights into budget utilization, platform effectiveness, creative performance, and audience behavior.

## Tools Used
